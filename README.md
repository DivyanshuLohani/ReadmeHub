# 🎃 README Contrib Wars

> *Making the world’s READMEs worse, one contribution at a time!*

Welcome to **README Contrib Wars** – a parody project where contributors can “improve” repositories by adding typos, random emojis, questionable quotes, and way too many exclamations!!!

Perfect for Hacktoberfest farming, GitHub trolling, or just a good laugh with friends.

---

## ✨ Features

* 📝 **Fix Typos** – because “projct” looks cooler anyway.
* 🚀 **Add Emojis** – the more the better, professionalism unlocked.
* 💬 **Add Quotes** – random wisdom no one asked for.
* ‼️ **Exclamation Overload** – excitement is mandatory!!!
* 📉 **Quality Meter** – always 0/10.
* 🔗 **Share Button** – brag about your “contributions” everywhere.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

1. Browse a fake repository in the dashboard.
2. Open its sacred `README.md`.
3. Choose your contribution weapon: typo, emoji, quote, or exclamation.
4. Watch the README spiral into chaos.
5. Share your masterpiece with friends for maximum viral effect.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Next.js 14 (App Router)** – because we like edge functions.
* **React / TailwindCSS** – for ✨ fancy gradients.
* **Prisma + SQLite/Postgres** – to track your terrible contributions.
* **shadcn/ui** – to make the joke look professional.

Because Hacktoberfest contributions aren’t about quality.
They’re about numbers. And memes.
